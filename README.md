## About The Project
A site designed to show off all the projects I have worked on!

### Built With
- React
- Tailwind

### Functionailty 
- Google's ReCaptcha 
- EmailJs on the form

### Site Performance
The site performs relatively well on desktop, on mobile however, the reCaptcha significantly slows the site, from looking online I could possibly change the reCaptcha to only initialise when the form is interacted with.
