# My portfolio website

## How it's built
This website was created use creater-react-app and styled using Tailwind, additionally I used npm packages which are listed in the package.json file.

# Site performance
The site performs relatively well on desktop, on mobile however, the reCaptcha significantly slows the site, from looking online I could possibly change the reCaptcha to only initialise when the form is interacted with.

## Getting started
